\section{Scope}
The scope of this document will concentrate on the hardware and software descriptions of the pfsense solution, alongside the proposed network design and integration into Rubin's network architecture. Be in mind that this document will also show images and information related to the "FY21 network re-design", so be aware that this firewall design is also part of that big picture. Migration will be also included but will not describe each activity in detail, since detailed information will be concentrated into JIRA tickets.
