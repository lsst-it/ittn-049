\section{Conclusion}

This firewall proposal is based on the well-known pfsense solution that is already in use on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory network, but with the benefits of 10Gbps interfaces for WAN and LAN, alongside a more well-suitable network design for base and summit facilities.

There are no hardware or software costs involved since all the materials were already under the control of the IT La Serena department, and the software is open-source based.

The activities required to perform a successful migration are less complicated than if we decided to go with another firewall solution different from pfsense. Also notice that the two new boxes are already running the latest software and are under development which is a plus in time, cost, and planning.

Again, be aware that this design is very tied to the FY21 network re-design, so most of the actual routing will change in the future to accommodate the design explained in this document, mainly on how both sites are going to reach Internet access.
