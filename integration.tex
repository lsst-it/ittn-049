\section{Integration}

\subsection{Integration with Rubin Observatory network}

Both boxes have the possibility to be monitored by IT monitoring services such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Graylog: Syslog monitoring system
    \item Icinga: Heartbeat and services monitoring system
    \item Grafana: Graphic telemetry monitoring system
\end{itemize}

Note: The actual setup is integrated with Graylog and Icinga monitoring services. Grafana hasn't been used in the past, but it's good to have in our monitoring system.


\subsection{Integration with third-party services}

There is coordination to be made and emails to be sent in order to inform third-party services about our firewall changes, in order to avoid cloud or third-party services outages.
